## Build

The emulator is written in C11 and can be compiled with most modern C compilers. In order to generate a Makefile you need to install [Premake](https://premake.github.io/). You also need to have [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) installed on your system or pass `--sdl-path=<path to lib>` to the premake script.

```
git clone https://github.com/andreas-jonsson/virtualxt.git
cd virtualxt
premake5 gmake
make sdl2-frontend
```

You can download pre-built binaries from [itch.io](https://phix.itch.io/virtualxt/purchase).

If you want to embed the emulator or create a custom frontend you can find libvxt API documentation [here](https://andreas-jonsson.github.io/virtualxt/docs).

## Validation

A hardware validator was developed to ensure proper CPU behaviour.
Some additional information about that can be found [here](https://hackaday.io/project/184209-virtualxt-hardware-validator).
